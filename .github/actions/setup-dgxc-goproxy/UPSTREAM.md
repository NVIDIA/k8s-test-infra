# Vendored: DGXC Go proxy adoption kit

`action.yml` and `oidc-exchange.sh` are **copied verbatim from upstream**, not
authored here. Editing them in place breaks the digest check in `make lint` and
forks us from upstream silently.

| Kit version | `v0.4.0` |
| Upstream commit | `328a004f84a94f77602fb92764e6753ab1c3b3db` |
| Source | <https://github.com/NVIDIA-dev/dgxc-depproxy> |

The commit was confirmed against what the `v0.4.0` tag dereferences to, not just
what the kit's own `VERSION` file claims.

## Why the digests are tracked

`MANIFEST.sha256` ships with the kit and answers two questions our own actions
never raise: has our copy been edited, and are we still on the version we think
we are. Its paths are repo-root relative, and it also lists files we deliberately
did not copy — `ADOPTION.md`, `VERSION`, and two example workflows that would
collide with this repo's own. `hack/check-depproxy-kit.sh` therefore asserts the
two files we did take are present rather than trusting `shasum --ignore-missing`
alone.

## Upgrading

```shell
gh release download <tag> --repo NVIDIA-dev/dgxc-depproxy

cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle checksums.txt.sigstore.json \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/NVIDIA-dev/dgxc-depproxy/\.github/workflows/release\.yml@refs/tags/' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  checksums.txt

shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing
tar -xzf dgxc-goproxy-adoption-kit_<tag>.tar.gz
```

Verify the publisher **before** the contents: the signature is what makes
`checksums.txt` trustworthy, and `checksums.txt` is what makes the archive
trustworthy. Checking the archive alone proves only that it downloaded intact.

Then copy `action.yml`, `oidc-exchange.sh` and `MANIFEST.sha256` over the files
here, update the table above, and run `make lint`.
