# Take the tag verbatim from the first `FROM golang:` line, stopping at the
# variant suffix (`-bookworm`, `-alpine`) so only the toolchain version remains.
#
# Matching digit runs instead (`grep -oE "[0-9\.]+"`) breaks on prerelease tags:
# `1.27rc1` matches twice, and the result reaches the caller as "1.27 1".
# Consumers require one whitespace-free token — variables.yaml writes it into
# $GITHUB_OUTPUT and run.sh passes it as a --build-arg.
